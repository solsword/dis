You come to a chaotic market and decide to browse for a bit.
 
A merchant seems knowledgeable and a noble is baselessly accusing the merchant of insolence and the merchant is selling a spear.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item You deny that the merchant is guilty and argue that the noble's accusation is baseless  \\
(You are missing skill: negotiation. The noble has skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{2}$\rightarrow$  You argue that the merchant has been wrongly accused, but the noble remains convinced that the merchant is guilty.  The situation remains the same. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the noble into a chicken  \\
(You have skill: sorcery. You have no tool for sorcery). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{1}$\rightarrow$ You try to cast a spell on the noble, but nothing happens. The situation remains the same. \\[-0.5em]
\item You travel onwards  \\
(no relevant skills). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{5}$\rightarrow$ You continue your journey. You have traveled to a new location.
\end{enumerate}
