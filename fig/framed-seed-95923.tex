You come to a busy market and decide to browse for a bit.
 
A thief seems knowledgeable and a noble is baselessly accusing a merchant of insolence.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item You talk the noble down  \\
(You have skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{12}$\rightarrow$ You reason with the noble and the noble calms down.  The noble is no longer accusing the merchant. \\[-0.5em]
\item You offer the noble your sack of gold  \\
(You have skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{0}$\rightarrow$ You bargain with the noble, but can not seem to reach a deal. The situation remains the same. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the noble into a chicken  \\
(You are missing skill: sorcery). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{0}$\rightarrow$ You cast a spell on the noble, and the noble is cursed with the form of a chicken. The noble is not accusing the merchant any more, the noble has been transformed into a chicken, the noble is now not sentient, the noble no longer has some perfume, and the noble no longer has an ancient grimoire.
\end{enumerate}
