You come to a chaotic market and decide to browse for a bit.
 
A merchant seems knowledgeable and a peasant is bored and a noble is baselessly accusing the merchant of disrespect and the merchant is selling a spear.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item You offer the noble your sack of gold  \\
(You have skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{2}$\rightarrow$  You bargain with the noble and reach a deal.  You have lost your sack of gold, the noble is not accusing the merchant any more, and the noble has a sack of gold now. \\[-0.5em]
\item You travel onwards  \\
(no relevant skills). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{5}$\rightarrow$ You continue your journey. You have traveled to a new place. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the noble into a chicken  \\
(You are missing skill: sorcery). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{1}$\rightarrow$ You try to cast a spell on the noble, but nothing happens. The situation remains the same.
\end{enumerate}
