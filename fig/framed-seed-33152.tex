You come to a chaotic market and decide to browse for a bit.
 
A peasant is bored and some bandits seem knowledgeable and they are threatening a merchant.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item You attack the bandits  \\
(You are missing skill: fighting. They have skill: fighting. They have no tool for fighting). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{2}$\rightarrow$  You attack them. They avoid your attack, but then you strike at the bandits, and you dodge the bandits' attack. They are defeated.  The bandits are not threatening the merchant any more, and they have been killed. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the bandits into a chicken  \\
(You are missing skill: sorcery). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{3}$\rightarrow$ You cast a spell on the bandits, and the bandits are cursed with the form of a chicken. The bandits no longer have any interesting gossip to share, they are no longer threatening the merchant, they have become a chicken, and they are now not sentient. \\[-0.5em]
\item You talk the bandits down  \\
(You are missing skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{9}$\rightarrow$ You reason with the bandits and the bandits calm down. The bandits are not threatening the merchant any more.
\end{enumerate}
