You come across some bandits attacking a merchant.
 
The bandits are threatening the merchant.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item You offer the bandits your perfume  \\
(You have skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{0}$\rightarrow$  You bargain with the bandits and reach a deal.  You have lost your perfume, the bandits are not threatening the merchant any more, and they now have some perfume. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the bandits into a chicken  \\
(You have skill: sorcery. You have your ancient grimoire). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{7}$\rightarrow$ You cast a spell on the bandits, and the bandits are cursed with the form of a chicken. The bandits are no longer threatening the merchant, they have become a chicken, and they are now not sentient. \\[-0.5em]
\item You talk the bandits down  \\
(You have skill: negotiation, and you have skill: storytelling). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{3}$\rightarrow$ You reason with the bandits and the bandits calm down. The bandits are not threatening the merchant any more.
