You come to a busy market and decide to browse for a bit.
 
A merchant seems knowledgeable and a peasant is bored and a noble is baselessly accusing the merchant of disrespect.
 
What do you do?

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item  You talk the noble down  \\
(You have skill: negotiation, and you have skill: storytelling). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{6}$\rightarrow$  You talk with the noble, but the noble refuses to back down.  The noble has started to yell at you. \\[-0.5em]
\item You transform the noble into a chicken  \\
(You have skill: sorcery. You have your ancient grimoire). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{0}$\rightarrow$ You try to cast a spell on the noble, but nothing happens. The situation remains the same. \\[-0.5em]
\item You deny that the merchant is guilty and argue that the noble's accusation is baseless  \\
(The noble is missing skill: negotiation. You have skill: negotiation). \\[0.3em]
\choicecount{5}$\rightarrow$ You argue that the merchant has been wrongly accused, but the noble remains convinced that the merchant is guilty. The situation remains the same.
