\chapter{Choice Poetics}

\label{ch:choice-poetics}

The aim of this chapter is twofold--first, to establish a framework for talking clearly and precisely about choices and their outcomes, and second, to introduce a method for analyzing choices based on how they relate to player goals.
%
Choice poetics should be able to address questions like: ``What is it about a choice that makes some players feel regret after picking a particular option?''
%
This chapter attempts to establish terminology and formal perspectives that can be used to talk about choices, but it's far from a ``complete'' theory of choice poetics: it only deals with explicit, discrete choices, for example.
%
Some parts of the theory are more developed (those that supported and were influenced by the development of \dunyazad/), but the ideas here are just the beginning of an in-depth study of narrative choices.


Note that here I define ``poetics'' broadly as the compliment of hermeneutics: if hermeneutics is the study of the meaning of a text, poetics can be understood as the study of its non-meaning-related qualities, such as the emotions or themes it evokes.
%
Poetics deals with the feelings that a player has before, during, and after making a choice, including simple feelings like the impression that a choice is difficult to make, but also complex feelings like regret.
%
It is also concerned with how these feelings help a work express themes or otherwise enhance the player's experience of a narrative, although the work presented here focuses mainly on the specifics of how choice structures engender feelings in the players who experience them.


\section{Inspirations}

\cref{ch:related-work} contains a full review of literature related to choice poetics, but some of the most relevant sources are worth reiterating here.
%
While choice poetics clearly has roots in the work of Aristotle \citep{Aristotle1917} (and more recent narrative formalists like Freytag \citep{Freytag1894} and Barthes \citep{Barthes1975}, to name only a few) choice poetics is also inspired by investigations into the psychology of both reading and decisions.
%
In the first camp, psychologists have studied specific narrative effects such as transportation \citep{Green2000}, surprise \citep{Iran-Nejad1987}, and identification \citep{Oatley1995}.
%
In the second camp, researchers have studied how things like framing \citep{Tversky1981,Tversky1993}, and personality \citep{Schwartz2002} affect decisions and preferences.


Including craft wisdom from places like the Choice of Games development blog \citep{ChoiceOfGamesGameDesignCategory}, existing sources already contain a lot of information about how narrative choices function.
%
However, much of it is focused on either linear narratives or real-world choices, and the resources that do explicitly deal with narrative choices lack a solid theoretical foundation.
%
Some of the work of this chapter is therefore synthesizing this existing information into a theory concerned primarily with discrete, explicit choices in narrative contexts.


\section{Modes of Engagement}


In developing a theory of choice poetics, one must respect the lessons of the development of traditional poetics.
%
In particular, modern scholars have largely rejected ``objective'' narrative analysis and concluded that the experience of the individual reader must be taken into account.
%
Unlike Aristotle, who stated authoritatively what was good and bad about this drama or that, modern narrative scholars will analyze a work from a particular perspective, without claiming that this perspective is universal, perhaps performing a feminist or Marxist reading of a novel to see what insights a particular lens has to offer about the work.


Choice poetics must also respect the perspective of the reader, but it is in a slightly different position, as its readers are also players.
%
Insofar as the narrative that contains choices is experienced through the fabric of a game, the reader/players (henceforth players) are stepping into the magic circle of the game \citep{Huizinga1949} and intentionally taking on certain attitudes.
%
A narrative experienced within the framework of a game thus implicitly biases the attitudes of its readers, for example by setting up a score counter which players can try to maximize.
%
Counter-play is of course possible and important, but even counter-play is influenced by the rules of the game by virtue of being set against them.
%
The formal structures of the game rules that accompany a narrative-with-choices thus allow the theoretician to make an educated guess about the attitudes of players interacting with a piece.


There are still a range of attitudes that players can take on, however, and some understanding of this range is important before any analysis of choices in a narrative.
%
This range of attitudes has to some degree been studied by others interested in player types, although such studies are mostly focused on games without regard to narrative.
%
From simple binary ``casual/hardcore'' distinctions to more complex typologies such as Bartle's ``achievers,'' ``explorers,'' ``socializers,'' and ``killers,'' player type classifications to some degree incorporate notions of player intent or attitude \citep{Bartle1996}.
%
However, player type classifications also focus on player actions or approaches within the game, for example a distinction between those who enjoy stealth or direct combat more.
%
These player content preferences are as important as any other player preferences when it comes to how players approach choices, but they're less important than player motivations, which establish entire contexts within which preferences can be expressed.
%
For example, if one's motivation to play is a desire to act out a role, one's preferences might be expressed in terms of the kind of role one is trying to act out.
%
If one's motivation to play is to score points, on the other hand, preferences might be expressed in terms of different strategies for doing so.


The idea of ``modes of engagement'' captures these different player motivations.
%
Modes of engagement are different ways in which a player can approach a game.\footnote{%
Note that the idea of modes of engagement is not unique to games: different audience approaches have been acknowledged as important in areas such as education and music composition \citep{Langer1995,Brown2001}.}
%
At this point it is important to note that modes of engagement are neither exclusive nor permanent: players often engage in several modes at once (to varying degrees) and may change their modes of engagement during the course of play.
%
The modes of engagement presented here are also not intended to be comprehensive: these are some of the most common modes, but others may be possible and even the norm for certain games.
%
All of that notwithstanding, consideration of the mode(s) of engagement that players bring to a work is the first step in analyzing the choice poetics of a work.


This can take the form of assuming a particular mode: much as one can perform a feminist reading of a novel, one could perform a power-playing playthrough of a game.
%
This could also take the form of analyzing the game itself to determine which mode(s) of engagement it encourages and rewards.
%
It could even take the form of a qualitative study of actual players, to determine which mode(s) of engagement they are employing.
%
In any case, an analysis of choice poetics that does not consider modes of engagement is incomplete.


\Cref{tab:modes-of-engagement} lists some of the most common modes of engagement, and gives examples of decisions that employ them.
%
The last column references Nick Yee's work on motivations for play in massively-multiplayer online role-playing games as a comparison \citep{Yee2006}.
%
The grouping of Yee's motivation components into these modes of engagement has to do with a difference in focus: Yee is focused primarily on aspects of play, including a strong focus on online social interaction, whereas choice poetics is interested primarily in single-player offline engagement with an emphasis on narrative.
%
For example, Yee makes fine distinctions between different motivations grouped into the ``power play'' category here, but from a choice poetics perspective, whether someone is trying to maximize score or compete with an opponent doesn't matter, because both motivations are equally orthogonal to the narrative, and thus they have a similar effect on the player's experience of the narrative.

\end{table}

Although modes of engagement are important to choice poetics, in my work with \dunyazad/ I have not given them great attention: \dunyazad/ encourages avatar play and all of its evaluations assume that players will engage primarily in this mode.
%
Extending \dunyazad/ to support power play and role play better, and to account for these possible approaches when evaluating choices, would be a very interesting line of future work.
%
Developing \dunyazad/ in that direction would allow it to be used as a tool to study modes of engagement in more detail.


\section{Dimensions of Player Experience}

When using choice poetics to analyze a narrative or even just a single choice, one must consider the range of expressiveness of narrative choices.
%
Aristotle devoted much of his analysis of emotion in \work{Poetics} to comedy and tragedy as these were enshrined in traditional forms in his day, but the full range of poetic effects is very broad, and includes both momentary impressions such as a single phrase that provokes disgust, and overall feelings, such as sympathy for a tragic figure.
%
To some degree, more complex effects depend on simpler ones, for example when an overall experience of sympathy depends on many individual positive evaluations of a character, along with negative reactions to bad things that happen to that character.
%
Of course, once choices are involved, the repertoire of effects is expanded, and it's important to have some understanding of what poetic effects a choice can possibly have.
%
Although no summary of possible poetic effects could hope to be complete, I have tried to list here a collection of important high-level aspects of a narrative experience that are strongly influenced by choice structures, including some which I believe are unique to narratives that contain choices.


\begin{table}[!p]

\caption[Dimensions of player experience]{Some aspects of player experience that are influenced by choice poetics, along with some hypotheses about what kinds of choices might support them.}
\label{tab:dimensions-of-experience}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:dimensions-of-experience} provides a brief overview of these important dimensions of player experience.
%
Except for identification, transportation, and immersion, each of these possible poetic qualities are unique to interactive narratives: without choices, they simply aren't possible.
%
Because of this, figuring out how choice structures contribute to these effects 
is an important task for choice poetics.
%
Of course, some of these effects, like agency, have already been extensively studied, often in broader contexts than just choice-based interactive narrative.
%
But it will still be important to understand how choice structures specifically contribute to these poetic qualities.
%
What follows is a preliminary analysis of each quality, based on craft wisdom and existing studies of games and real-world choices.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Immersion} -- There are several different phenomena that the word immersion can refer to in games, including sensory immersion, mechanical immersion, and narrative immersion (see \citep{Ermi2005}).
%
Narrative choices of the kind studied here bear most on narrative immersion, although they could also be a source of mechanical immersion in some cases.
%
Immersion goes hand-in-hand with effects like identification and transportation.
%
Although counting immersion as a poetic quality discounts the role of the reader to some degree, immersion isn't independent of the structure of a narrative either.
%
In particular, it is possible for a narrative (choice-based or otherwise) to disrupt player engagement when it contains contradictions or otherwise complicates the reader's ability to understand it (see e.g., \citep{Douglas2001}).
%
This is particularly relevant when choices become involved, as they can easily become a source of frustration, either because the player wants to take an action which isn't provided as an option, or because the player views an outcome as inconsistent with the option that led to it.


\item \textbf{Identification} -- Identification in traditional narrative is a key property and is heavily influenced by the actions and attitudes of characters (see e.g., \citep{Feilitzen1975,Oatley1995}).
%
In narratives that include choices, the player usually has some control over the actions of one or more character(s), although this control is often incomplete, especially when it comes to attitudes rather than actions.
%
This degree of control can enable a different type of identification in which the player actually assumes the psychological perspective of a character, as opposed to viewing them as a role model (see \citep{Klimmt2009}).
%
Choices can have a big impact on identification if they fail to include options which the player believes are reasonable and which correspond to the choice that the player would be most comfortable with in a given situation, simply because such a situation is an explicit manifestation of a difference between the player and the character.
%
For example, if the player is a pacifist, but there are never options for negotiating with enemies or otherwise resolving conflicts peacefully, one would expect identification to be hindered.
%
This is complicated by role-playing, however: there is no reason that a player who is a pacifist in real life cannot enjoy the opportunity to play a bloodthirsty character in a game.


\item \textbf{Transportation} -- Transportation is the re-centering of a player's perspective from the real world into a fictional world, and is closely linked with narrative immersion (see \citep{Green2000}).
%
  Although the original research on transportation focused on linear narratives (both textual and visual), a similar phenomenon called presence has been studied in interactive contexts \citep{Witmer1998}.
%
Unlike immersion, transportation is exclusive to contexts that involve fictional worlds.
%
Transportation is also to some degree linked to identification, as when one identifies with a character it becomes easier to project oneself into that character's world.
%
Again, the believability and completeness of options and outcomes is important when choices come into the picture.
%
In particular, feelings of control and an ability to successfully predict developments have been implicated as contributing to presence (see \citep{Witmer1998}).

\item \textbf{Agency} -- Agency has been a core focus of games studies as a feeling uniquely enabled by interactive media (see e.g., \citep{Murray1997,Mateas2001,WardripFruin2009,Mason2013}).
%
The feeling of empowerment that results from being able to achieve one's goals contributes to agency, and an alignment of player goals with player-influenced outcomes is a powerful formula for agency \citep{Mateas2001}.
%
Obviously, such an alignment relates intimately to choice structures, as choice structures establish which outcomes can be influenced by the player and also help set player expectations as to their goals.
%
Given this, opaque choices--where the player is not able to foresee consequences given the setup and options--may decrease agency, because even if an outcome advances player goals, the player may not feel responsible for their success.
%
Additionally, choices where outcomes are tangential to a player's goals can frustrate agency: if you're told to save the princess but then given only choices about which commodities to buy or sell, your ability to proactively pursue your goal has been stifled.


\item \textbf{Influence} -- Related to agency, but slightly simpler, is the concept of influence: how influential the player feels within the narrative world.
%
Influence can be either \emph{passive} or \emph{active}: passive influence is the ability to affect the success or failure of some important event, whereas active influence is the ability to decide between substantially different plot developments.
%
A game like Final Fantasy \citep{FinalFantasy} gives the player mostly passive influence: the player-controlled characters are hugely influential in the story world, and the player's choices when successful drive that influence, but the player has very few choices that actually decide between different fates for the world, and in fact many key character decisions are taken out of the hands of the player.
%
A game like Sim City \citep{SimCity} provides active influence: the story of the city that the player creates will turn out differently depending on the choices the player makes.
%
Of course, Sim City is not usually thought of as a narrative game, and there are fundamental problems with providing active influence in games that have strong stories.

  \item \textbf{Autonomy} -- Autonomy is also related to agency and influence, and can be summarized as the player's ability to choose and pursue their own goals within a game.
%
Some amount of active influence is required to have autonomy, but whereas influence is concerned with outcomes, autonomy is concerned with goals.
%
A game that supports player autonomy provides a play-space within which players can choose their own goals.
%
To the extent that a narrative-focused game can provide this, it will appear more as a space for player-created stories than a fixed story that affords the player some choice.
%
Games like Sim City \citep{SimCity} and The Sims \citep{TheSims} provide play spaces within which players can create their own narratives, and this is achieved by offering non-explicit non-discrete choices which give the player a huge amount of options.
%
A lesser degree of autonomy can be present in more linear narratives when the player has choices which affect the goals and priorities of characters within the story.

  \item \textbf{Responsibility} -- A feeling of responsibility for one's own actions (as distinct from empathizing with a character who feels the burden of responsibility) is something uniquely afforded by interactive narratives.
%
Choice structures are key to creating this, and there are several conditions for enabling responsibility.
%
First, the player must be given moral agency within the story world, which means that different outcomes at a choice must have consequences which have morally different outcomes.
%
Second, the player must be willing to take responsibility for their actions, and this can be impeded when they feel that the outcomes of their actions were unforeseeable or otherwise out of their control (of course, the feeling of a player who mentally justifies their lack of culpability for an in-game consequence is also an interesting poetic effect).
%
Note that this direct player-responsibility is different from role-played responsibility: it's possible for a player to role-play responsibility even when the actions they are assuming responsibility for were completely outside their control.
%
An example of responsibility (or the shirking thereof) as a poetic effect happens in the game Portal \citep{Portal}, when the player is forced to incinerate their companion cube in order to progress within the game.
%
The complex emotions that arise at that moment are the result of a forced choice between two bad outcomes (being unable to progress and incinerating the companion cube\footnote{Note that this analysis makes assumptions about the player's goals and feelings: some player communities see the companion cube itself as an obstacle worthy of hatred rather than a helper who deserves pity, and so view this choice in a very different light.}), and the moment has emotional resonance later in the game when the player has the opportunity to destroy GLaDOS--the agent which forced the decision upon the player.


  \item \textbf{Regret} -- Like responsibility, the capacity to make players feel regret is unique to interactive narrative.
%
Again, in linear narrative it is possible to sympathize and empathize with a character who is feeling regret within the story, but that's a different feeling than personal regret for one's own actions.
%
As with responsibility, making a player feel regret is quite delicate: the player not only has to achieve some level of transportation and identification, but the choices involved must be structured to resist the player's natural tendency to reassign blame.
%
With a negative emotion like regret, the basic psychological mechanisms of denial are the brain's first line of defence, and so naturally the narrative and choices leading up to a moment of regret will be scrutinized for interpretations that leave the player blameless.
%
In particular, if the player can convince themselves that the game forced them to make a choice that led to a negative outcome, or that the outcome was unforeseeable given the option that led to it, they can avoid regret.
%
Of course, this process of denial is an interesting poetic effect in its own right, and in some cases is exactly what an author wants (perhaps so they can later force the player to re-examine their denial and admit blame, thus experiencing even more poignant regret).
%
A game like The Walking Dead \citep{TheWalkingDead} forces the player to make many difficult decisions between options with divergent but uniformly negative consequences, and this pattern engenders feelings of desperation and regret.

\end{itemize}


Each of these topics could be (and some of them have been) the topic of dedicated research.
%
However, they are presented here merely to demonstrate how much there is to learn about choice poetics--\dunyazad/ as a system does not focus on any of these, but rather attempts to get at some simpler phenomena, such as what makes an individual choice obvious, or what is required for a choice to be seen as a dilemma.
%
Patterns of choices with specific properties such as obviousness or unexpectedness of outcomes come together to produce higher-level poetic effects like those described here, and a better understanding of these low-level effects is required in order to aim at higher-level effects.
%
The poetic details that \dunyazad/ actually operationalizes are based on player goals, and the perceived relevance of options and outcomes to them.
%
As \dunyazad/ only reasons about one choice at a time, its logic effectively comprises an analysis technique for examining the basic poetic properties of an individual choice.
%
The next section describes this technique and how a human would apply it to an individual choice within an interactive narrative, while \cref{ch:dunyazad} describes how \dunyazad/ operationalizes this theory, and \cref{ch:results} describes how results from experiments using \dunyazad/ have informed both the theory and the system.

\section{Goal-Based Choice Analysis}

\label{sec:goal-based-choice-analysis}

When authoring a choice or attempting to understand an existing choice, the method of analysis presented here can help tease out how a choice might be perceived by players.
%
This method is grounded in player goals: it views each option and outcome through the lens of what the player wants, and then tries to synthesize this information to understand how an entire choice is perceived.
%
\cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} gives an overview of the technique described in this section, which consists of seven steps.
%
The basic idea is to carefully break down how the options and outcomes relate to player goals, attempting to consider as many details as possible, and then synthesize those detailed assessments back into high-level assessments of the choice as a whole.
%
The next section describes in detail how a discrete, explicit choice is represented for this analysis, and the seven analysis steps are described in the sections that follow.

\caption[Choice analysis flowchart]{Goal-based choice analysis for a single choice--an overview of the different steps and the information produced.}
\label{fig:choice-analysis-method}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Choice Representation}

\label{sec:cp-choice-representation}

This method is developed primarily for the analysis of explicit discrete choices, and for these choices a detailed breakdown of their structure is possible.
%
\Cref{fig:choice-anatomy} shows how a choice (in this case one generated by \dunyazad/) can be broken down into framing, options, and outcomes.
%
Note that it can be useful to further break down the outcomes into individual components: changes that result from an option which are individually significant.
%
By doing so, the impact of each outcome component on individual player goals can be analyzed separately, which helps understand outcomes that involve complex trade-offs between multiple goals.
%
Not shown in \cref{fig:choice-anatomy} are the unrealized outcome components which nevertheless factor into the choice analysis.
%
For example, if the player were unlucky, the third option might not have resulted in the bandits calming down, and one could even imagine a situation where the bandits might turn on the player.
%
Understanding what the player thinks \emph{might} happen as a result of choosing a given option is just as important as recognizing what does happen as the story unfolds.
%
This idea of potential outcome components can also help analyze cases where a system is nondeterministic, and the outcomes of a choice vary between playthroughs.
%
Each part of a choice is subject scrutiny using the methodology presented here, and having precise language to talk about these choice components is necessary for detailed analysis.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Goal Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-goal-analysis}

As already mentioned, poetic analysis of a choice depends on some understanding of the player's approach to the choice.
%
For goal-based choice analysis, this is taken into account by coming up with a list of player goals.
%
Depending on the objective of analysis, there are different ways to come up with this list.
%
One method is to simply list the goals that the analyst themselves would have when approaching the choice.
%
Another is to try to put oneself in the shoes of a particular type of player, perhaps according to one of the modes of engagement listed above.
%
This can be useful for an author trying to figure out how different types of players will perceive a choice: just come up with goal lists corresponding to each player type of interest and perform separate analyses using each list.


In any case, coming up with these lists should take into account not only the desires of the actual or imagined player, but also what aspects of the framing of the choice and previous content encourage which player goals.
%
Based on the options available at previous choices and the narrative content, games can not only encourage certain general modes of engagement, but can establish and encourage the pursuit of specific goals.
%
This encouragement itself often depends on a player's mode of engagement to function as intended, however.
%
For example, game rules directly establish goals for power gamers, but player who have a different mode of engagement may not care about those goals.


If an important goal is missing from the goal list, the entire analysis may be skewed, so it's important to consider the full set of probable player goals.
%
On the other hand, it's always possible to come back to the goal analysis if one realizes during a later step that there's an additional goal that might be relevant. 
%
This is not uncommon, as the particular set of options and outcomes at a choice  determines which goals are relevant.
%
However, part of the point of performing goal analysis before even considering the structure of the choice in question is to avoid bias.
%
This also means that the results of goal analysis can be re-used when analyzing multiple choices.
%
Of course, player goals may change over the course of a game, and this must be taken into account, but performing a full goal analysis from scratch for each individual choice is generally not necessary.


Besides just listing player goals, a goal analysis must give some notion of their relative priorities.
%
This can be as simple as sorting the goals into ``high'' and ``low'' priority tiers, but a more detailed representation of priorities can also be used.
%
This priority information is used when combining information about multiple options and outcomes during the relative option analysis and full outcome analysis steps.
%
Because goal priorities are even more volatile and difficult to estimate than goals themselves, sometimes it's simplest just to wait until the later analysis steps to consider goal priorities, as there will likely be only a few specific goals (those relevant to the choice in question) for which priorities actually affect the analysis.


\subsection{Likelihood Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-likelihood-analysis}

The second step of analysis is to figure out which potential outcome components are made to seem likely by the framing and option text of the choice.
%
For each option, this step starts by identifying a set of outcome components that seem plausible, and then figuring out which of those are likely and unlikely.
%
The goal of this step is to identify outcome components that the player can presume will result from each option, so if there are actually multiple conflicting likely scenarios, none of them counts as `likely.'
%
For example, if one option involves rolling a six-sided die, but the player has been given a prophecy that the result will be either a six or a one, then the outcome components associated with rolling a six and those associated with rolling a one are all neutral in this analysis, while outcome components associated with other rolls are unlikely. 
%
Any outcome component that's associated with both rolling a six and rolling a one would still be marked as likely: given the information the player has, they can assume that such an outcome component will happen if they choose to roll the die.


The outcome likelihoods produced by this step are used during option analysis in combination with the list of player goals from the goal analysis to figure out how each option portrays itself as affecting each goal.
%
\Cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} displays these assignments in the `Outcome Likelihoods' box: the choice has two options, `O1' and `O2,' and O1 has outcome components `A' and `B,' while O2 has outcome components `C' and `D.'
%
Components `A' and `B' are both neutrally likely (indicated by a `?'), while component `C' is unlikely (a `U') and component `D' is likely (an `L').
%
Note that it's possible and even common for the same outcome component to be a plausible result of multiple options, although that situation is not shown in \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method}.


During this step, the actual outcomes of each option are irrelevant; what's important are the cues present in the framing and options that hint at what might happen if an option is elected.
%
This often includes a large body of implicit player knowledge that depends on player experience with a game: players who have played a game already (or even just games from the same genre) may build strong expectations from minimal cues.
%
Much like player goals, potential and likely outcomes from a player's perspective can be difficult to predict perfectly.
%
However, from a designer's perspective, each choice is usually explicitly crafted to present certain outcomes as most salient, and in that case, this step of analysis is mostly focused on double-checking the framing and options to ensure that they highlight the intended outcomes properly.


\subsection{Option Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-option-analysis}

Given the player goals and estimates of likely-seeming outcome components, option analysis proceeds by analyzing how each option seems likely to impact each goal.
%
First, all possible outcome components are considered, to come up with an estimate of the goals that could \emph{possibly} be impacted by each option.
%
These evaluations are `enables' and `threatens'--which goals each option might possibly advance, and which goals it might possibly impede.
%
In \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} the `+' and `-' symbols in the `Option Expectations' box are these enables and threatens assignments.


Essentially, these enables and threatens evaluations are produced by considering the impact of each outcome component on each goal.
%
If any possible outcome component of an option could negatively impact a particular player goal, then that goal is deemed threatened by that option.
%
Likewise, if an outcome component can positively impact a goal, that goal is enabled by the corresponding option.
%
It is possible and even common for an option to both enable and threaten the same goal, and of course it's also possible that it neither enables nor threatens a goal.


Besides possible impacts of each choice, option analysis is also concerned with likely impacts.
%
Using the same procedure, but this time only considering likely outcomes, `advances' and `hinders' option expectations are assigned to each option/goal pairing (these are the `*' and `!' symbols in \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method}).
%
If it's not clear whether an option advances or hinders a goal (perhaps because of multiple conflicting outcome components), neither label should be assigned: the enables and threatens labels should already be present and serve to indicate the possible but uncertain outcome relative to that goal.
%
On the other hand, if contrary indicators are present but one is clearly stronger or much more likely than another, the label more strongly indicated can be assigned, but this should only be done if the player can safely assume that the goal will be affected as indicated, as that is the purpose of these labels.
%
Note that an advances label can only be present if there is an enables label, and similarly a hinders label requires the presence of a threatens label.
%
The combination of enables, threatens, and one of either advances or hinders is common, and indicates an option that will probably advance or hinder a goal but with some risk involved.


Remember that this step still makes no use of the actual outcomes of an option: it is just concerned with how the player views each option before making a decision.
%
It can also ignore the goal priorities because each goal is considered separately.
%
The option expectations produced by this step are used in the relative option analysis and retrospective analysis steps as a formal representation of how the player views each option.
%
During those analyses more fine-grained evaluations of player perceptions may be required on a case-by-case basis, but the enables/threatens/advances/hinders labels allow such complicated cases to quickly be separated from the simple cases.


\subsection{Relative Option Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-relative-option-analysis}

After producing option expectations for each goal/option pairing, a full-blown analysis of the choice from a pre-decision standpoint can be produced by comparing the options available.
%
A set of prospective impression labels can be used to identify common option structures, and choices that don't easily fit into a known category can be examined more closely.
%
This step uses not only the option expectations from the option analysis step, but also the goal priorities that were produced during goal analysis.


Certain common patterns of option expectations create well-understood prospective impressions.
%
For example, a dilemma has a specific feel, and several types of dilemma can be easily identified by comparing option expectations.
%
If there are exactly two options at a choice, each has overall negative impacts on high-priority player goals (and these impacts are roughly balanced), and each option negatively impacts a different set of goals, then the choice is a classic dilemma.
%
All of this information (besides the balance of impacts) is directly encoded in the option expectations, so classic dilemmas are easy to identify using this analysis method.
%
From a design standpoint, it's also easy to identify when an option isn't a classical dilemma and which aspects of that option would need to change to make it one.
%
Given the detailed language of choice analysis it's further possible to imagine other kinds of dilemmas: a two-option choice with balanced positive outcomes, or a three-option choice that still has balanced outcomes, or even a tradeoff choice where each option has positive impacts on one of two goals and negative impacts on the other.
%
This is one of the benefits of a detailed analysis technique, in fact: developing the precise language necessary for describing choices formally establishes a framework within which variations on a common pattern can be identified and enumerated.

\caption[Prospective choice impressions]{Several different prospective impression labels, with formal criteria based on option expectations and goal priorities. Note: see \cref{sec:results-prospective-caveats} for a detailed discussion of some of these labels informed by experimental results.}
\label{tab:prospective-impressions}
\end{table}


\Cref{tab:prospective-impressions} gives an overview of some prospective impression labels and the criteria for applying them based on goal priorities and option expectations.
%
Note that the criteria are designed to be sufficient for applying the label, but are probably not necessary--there are certainly some obvious choices which don't meet the strict criteria set out here, but from a design standpoint, if the criteria are met, a choice is almost certainly obvious (assuming also that the goal and outcome analyses are accurate of course).
%
The labels in \cref{tab:prospective-impressions} and their criteria were developed as part of \dunyazad/'s choice analysis component, and some of them (the depressing, empowering, obvious, and relaxed labels) were refined based on experimental results (see \cref{ch:results}).


As a preview of those results, one caveat that applies to the relaxed label is that some people will always seek a best possible outcome when given a choice, and thus even at a choice among supposedly positive outcomes options which appear to lead to \emph{relatively} worse outcomes may be seen as bad options.
%
See \cref{sec:results-prospective-caveats} for further discussion of some extra considerations for applying these labels.


The labels presented here give an idea of how players will feel when faced with this choice before they make a decision.
%
Classic dilemmas, for example, are stressful decisions which are difficult to make, and they represent significant negative events.
%
In linear narrative, dilemmas and their consequences are commonly used as low points in a story, and are themselves often a result of a character's previous poor decision, in effect serving as extended punishment: the character must not only suffer a negative consequence, but must also choose which consequence to accept, thereby being forced to reflect on their initial decision while agonizing about their present options.
%
Despite being negative moments, dilemmas can also serve as moments of clarity: when a character finally confronts the bad options available to them and makes a decision, this can mark the end of denial about their situation and ultimately the beginning of redemption.


In an interactive narrative, presenting the player with a dilemma can serve the same purposes: to accentuate an earlier mistake and punish the player, while perhaps also establishing a new goal of moving towards atonement.
%
A classic dilemma is a moment of heightened tension, and when a player is forced to make the decision it also represents a pause in the action, although a dilemma where the player has limited time to choose can also be used to accentuate feelings of urgency and haste.
%
Additionally, the intense consideration of options that a dilemma provokes can serve to heighten immersion and promote transportation.
%
The player will presumably dedicate significant mental energy to consider which option is the lesser of two evils, and when the options at a dilemma are diagetic, this thinking is done from a perspective within the narrative world.
%
Also, since diegetic dilemmas force the player to make an important decision for their avatar and to ``think as'' their avatar, they can promote identification.


Dilemmas can be very fragile, however, because if the goals hindered by the two options are not well-balanced, the choice can become obvious.
%
A dilemma may also force a player to re-evaluate their priorities, especially when the player goals involved relate to different modes of engagement.
%
For example, if one option hinders a player's ludic goal of becoming more powerful (without necessarily affecting a similar diegetic goal) while another hinders the diegetic goal of preserving the safety of their avatar's ally, many players may simply make a decision to prioritize one mode of engagement (avatar play or power play, in this example) over the other, and thus avoid the dilemma.
%
Of course, a choice like this that forces the player to decide between orthogonal goals can be used intentionally by an author to build divergent experiences for players who presumably prioritize different things.
%
Such a choice not only measures a player's priorities but also probably affects them: human cognitive biases related to self-consistency and rationalization mean that once a player commits to a certain mode of engagement they are likely to stick with that choice. 


A label like `dilemma' can thus be unpacked into a rich understanding of the poetics of a choice.
%
Beyond assigning such well-understood labels, however, relative option analysis can also find choices which don't strictly conform to any labels, and analyze them on a case-by-case basis.
%
It is often useful to compare a specific choice structure to known structures and focus on the differences.
%
For example, a choice that meets all the criteria for being obvious but at which the best options also hinders a high-priority goal could be compared to an obvious choice.
%
In this case, the relative merits of the goals advanced and hindered by the best option might mean that the decision is still straightforward, but even so the player may feel some reluctance that a normal obvious choice would not create.
%
Alternatively, because of the hindered goal and despite the advanced goal, an option which threatens some unimportant goal and has no other expectations might be more desirable than the `best' option if the player is risk-averse, creating a very different impression.
%
The relatively narrow labels presented here thus serve as anchor points for the analysis of more complex choices.
%
Of course, it's possible to establish many more clearly-defined labels than those presented in \cref{tab:prospective-impressions}, and doing so is a straightforward way to increase our understanding of choice poetics.


\subsection{Outcome Component Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-outcome-component-analysis}

While the results of relative option analysis give a sense of how a choice is perceived just before the player makes a decision, more work is necessary to understand how a player feels after experiencing an outcome.
%
This begins with outcome component analysis: Using the list of player goals and the outcome components identified during likelihood analysis (although ignoring their likelihoods), a breakdown of the actual impact of each outcome component on each player goal is created.
%
Recall that the option analysis step already summarized how the framing and options of a choice indicated goals would be affected, but during this step, actual effects based on actual outcomes are considered.


An example of this distinction can be helpful: let's say the player has been flung off of a cliff and faces a choice between grabbing a nearby branch to save themselves or grabbing the outstretched hand of their avatar's only child, who is also falling.
%
As presented, the outcomes look grim: sacrifice any hope of saving one's child to save oneself, or catch one's child and at least suffer the same fate.
%
Assuming that the player can't reasonably expect some sort of miracle to save them (even given the full implications of genre conventions, etc.) both options are portrayed to have likely negative impacts on several player goals (assuming an avatar play mode of engagement).
%
But perhaps if the player chooses to grab their child, the actual outcome is that a freak gust of wind blows them both to safety, while if they choose to grab the branch, their child falls and dies.
%
The goal of outcome components is to analyze the valence of actual outcome components with respect to each player goal, including any components that weren't suggested by the framing and options of a choice.


The method is simple: for each outcome component that actually happens at each option (or when outcomes are non-deterministic, for each outcome component that could happen), estimate its impact on each player goal.
%
The `Outcome Evaluations' table in \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} that results from outcome component analysis illustrates this, using `+', and `-' for minor positive and negative consequences, and `*' and `!' for major consequences respectively.
%
Of course, a finer gradation of consequences could be used if desired, and certainly should be employed on a case-by-case basis where specific consequences must be compared, but gross distinctions are often sufficient to analyze straightforward choice structures.


Note that even though the outcome component `C' of option `O2' does not actually occur according to the `Actual Outcomes' table, it is still analyzed in this example, perhaps because it might occur depending on the circumstances.
%
There are thus three categories of outcome components: suggested components that are hinted at by the framing and option text of a choice, but which may or may not even be possible, potential components which are possibilities given a specific decision, actual components which actually happen in a given play-through, and unrealized components which could have happened given a particular decision but did not.
%
In the example analysis from \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method}, outcome components `A,' `B,' and `C' are both suggested and potential, while component `D' is only suggested.
%
Meanwhile, components `A,' `B,' and `E' are actual, while `C' is unrealized; note that component `E' is not a suggested component.
%
Depending on the interactive narrative, complex rules may exist that establish what configurations of actual outcome components out of the set of potential outcome components are valid, and the player may or may not be aware of these rules.
%
If analysis is being conducted without a specific playthrough in mind, then in latter stages the different possible combinations of potential outcome components will have to be considered separately, as each may give rise to a different player experience.
%
Of course, player experiences must already be separated based on which option is chosen, but this does add some complexity to the analysis.
%
In the rest of this chapter outcomes are assumed to be deterministic, as that is the case for choices generated by \dunyazad/, and it generally makes analysis much more straightforward.
%
Once an understanding of how each potential outcome component affects each goal is reached, this information can be used to analyze the possible outcomes.


\subsection{Full Outcome Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-full-outcome-analysis}

By combining information from the goal analysis, likelihood analysis, and outcome component analysis steps, as well as information on which outcome components are actual for each option, a full picture of the effects of choosing each option can be assembled.
%
This stage of analysis summarizes some details of earlier stages to make common choice configurations easy to recognize, although for complicated structures these summaries may be insufficient and the results of earlier analyses will need to be used directly by the final retrospective analysis.
%
The goal of this stage of analysis is to establish two main evaluations for each option (and the corresponding outcome components): first, to what degree was the result expected, unexpected, or unpredictable, and second, was the outcome overall a good one, a bad one, a tradeoff, or irrelevant.


The evaluation of expectedness relies on comparing option likelihoods from the likelihood analysis step with actual outcomes.
%
First, however, each outcome component is established as either `important' or `unimportant' based on whether or not it affects any high-priority player goals (using actual effects, not merely indicated effects).
%
Any outcome which is established as an alternative to an important outcome is also important, even if that outcome does not itself interact with a high-priority player goal.
%
When judging expectedness and valence of outcomes, unimportant outcome components are ignored (for a more detailed analysis using graded goal priorities, just factor goal priority into the expectedness and valence judgements as a weighting factor).


Given important outcome components, the results of an option can be said to be completely `predictable' if every important actual outcome component at that option was identified as a likely component by the likelihood analysis.
%
Options where the important outcome components have a mix of likely and neutral likelihood fall somewhere between `predictable' and `unpredictable,' with options where all important components have neutral likelihood are fully `unpredictable.'
%
If \emph{any} important outcome component was marked as unlikely, however, the results are `unexpected,' and the same is true if there is an important outcome component that was not a suggested component at all (and thus does not appear in the likelihood analysis).
%
A simple analysis can use these three evaluations as exclusive labels, while a more nuanced analysis might represent the space between predictable, unpredictable, and unexpected outcomes as a continuous triangle as shown in the `Per-Option Assessments' block of \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} (in this case only the assessment for the first option is shown).


Besides predictability, outcomes have valences, which represent whether they are overall good, bad, or somewhere in-between.
%
Shown in \cref{fig:choice-analysis-method} is a simple good/bad/irrelevant/tradeoff scheme, but finer distinctions can be made within each category (for example whether a tradeoff is generally worth it or not).
%
Essentially, these evaluations summarize all goal impacts of the actual outcome components of an option, taking into account the relative strengths of each impact and the relative priorities of the associated goals.
%
Although this summarization step may muddle things in more complicated cases, it can be helpful for quickly identifying the simple cases: often the results of each option are simply purely good or bad in terms of important player goals, and their impact on the player can be judged accordingly.


By assigning a single predictability value and valence to each option at a choice, it becomes much easier to get an overall picture of how the choice might look in retrospect given a particular decision.
%
Along with the prospective impressions established by the relative option analysis step, these per-outcome assessments are used by the final retrospective analysis step to understand how the player perceives an option after they've made a decision.


\subsection{Retrospective Analysis}

\label{sec:cp-retrospective-analysis}


Retrospective analysis is the final step in the goal-driven option analysis framework presented here, although the results of the relative option analysis step can sometimes be used in isolation.
%
Retrospective analysis complements relative option analysis by providing an understanding of how the player feels after making a decision and experiencing an outcome at a choice.
%
Note that further comparative analysis of outcomes would be necessary to understand how a player might view a choice after experiencing multiple outcomes, but the usual case in which a player only experiences a single outcome doesn't need this extra step.


As with the relative option analysis, this step is focused on matching against a set of characteristic option structures.
%
Note that each option is treated independently, although prospective impressions of the entire option set apply no matter which option is under scrutiny.
%
\Cref{tab:retrospective-impressions} lists some retrospective impressions identified during the creation of \dunyazad/ and the formal criteria for each.

\caption[Retrospective outcome impressions]{Several retrospective impression labels, with formal criteria based on option expectations, prospective impressions, and option assessments. Note: see \cref{sec:results-retrospective-caveats} for more precise versions of some of these informed by experimental results.}
\label{tab:retrospective-impressions}
\end{table}


As with the prospective impression labels, retrospective impression labels are fairly narrow, but ``near misses'' can often be analyzed as a variant of a known case.
%
For example, an option that almost fits the ``bad gamble'' profile but for which there \emph{is} another option that seemed distinctly better has a slightly different feel from a normal bad gamble, but the difference isn't drastic (mainly, the player may place more blame for the failure on their own decision-making than on simple bad luck).
%
A full picture of how player feels after a choice combines prospective and retrospective impressions, for example: An obvious choice at which the player chose the `best' option which resulted in an expected success.
%
Options other than the chosen one can still influence the overall impression, especially by accentuating bad results (when multiple options seemed promising) or good results (when all options seemed bad).
%
Regret in particular is an example of a poetic effect that depends heavily on the nature of options-not-chosen.


\section{Overview \& Future Work}

The analysis method presented here is heavily dependent on identifying well-understood prospective and retrospective impressions and good criteria for their application.
%
However, this chapter only presents a few of these impressions, and it does not contain a comprehensive analysis of the poetic effects that they can create.
%
In other words, the theory of choice poetics described here is still preliminary.
%
However, this goal-based choice analysis is a strong framework for understanding nuanced choices, because decomposing options and outcome components can help untangle complex choice structures.
%
Additionally, by separating player goal analysis from the main choice analysis and taking modes of engagement into account, this method makes the dependencies between desired impressions and particular player goals visible to designers.
%
It could thus be helpful for debugging key choice structures that aren't producing a desired impression, and for figuring out whether a game supports different modes of engagement.


The few impressions that have been presented here have also been verified to some degree by the experiments presented in \cref{ch:results}.
%
In fact, the results of those experiments did not unanimously confirm my hypotheses, which has led to refinements in the analysis technique presented here.
%
These revisions and others that were made as I built \dunyazad/ are the primary product of my hybrid research method: a more nuanced understanding of choice poetics obtained by attempting to operationalize it.


The next step in this direction of research would be to greatly expand the number of prospective and retrospective impressions scrutinized.
%
An efficient approach would be to take a well-known interactive experience built around explicit discrete narrative choices and analyze it from the beginning, breaking down each choice within this framework and looking for patterns in their usage.
%
\dunyazad/ could then be used to double-check and refine the insights generated by this process: take each impression identified during the initial analysis, encode it in \dunyazad/, and ask \dunyazad/ to generate choices that involve that impression.
%
Some of the choices generated will likely not appear to give that impression upon initial inspection, and \dunyazad/'s full output can be used to figure out exactly how the criteria that were developed technically fit the generated choice.
%
With this information, refinements to \dunyazad/ and/or the underlying theory can be made, eventually producing both an analytical and a generative model of the impression in question, and completing the analysis $\rightarrow$ theory $\rightarrow$ generative model $\rightarrow$ experimentation cycle.


The next chapter describes in detail how \dunyazad/ operates, and part of it mirrors this one: an automated version of the analysis technique described here forms the core of \dunyazad/'s reasoning capabilities.
%
After that, \cref{ch:results} discusses the results of two experiments that showed outputs from \dunyazad/ to humans and gathered feedback about their impressions.
%
\Cref{ch:results} includes some updates to the material presented here, as the refinements make the most sense when presented alongside the experimental results that led to them.
